We combined the passion of filming and editing with our love for flying radio control models. With more than 20 years of experience, we bring to the Portland metro area a new point of view, a new angle and a new story: Yours.

If you need to show an event, introduce a new produce, demonstrate functionality or simply add some nice angles of your property, farm or area, we are here to help.

With multiple drones and pilots to get you cover. Powerful editing systems to take care of your project entirely.

We combine aerial film with regular film. We utilize professional DSLR cameras, the best microphones and the best calibrated lights for interviews or events.

We can produce all you need, or just the parts you need help with.
